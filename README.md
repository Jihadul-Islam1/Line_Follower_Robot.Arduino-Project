# Autonomous Line-Following Car

## Objective  
The goal of this project is to design and construct an autonomous line-following car that can detect and follow a defined path using infrared (IR) sensors. By integrating sensor data with motor control, the car adjusts its direction as needed to stay on course, showcasing basic autonomous navigation.

---

## Features  
- IR sensors for line detection.
- L298N motor driver for motor control.
- Arduino-based system for processing and control.
- Adjustable motor speed via PWM signals.
- Simple and scalable design.

---

## Components  
- **Arduino Board (e.g., Arduino Uno)**: Microcontroller for processing sensor input and controlling motors.  
- **IR Sensors (2 units)**: Detect the line and provide input to the Arduino.  
- **L298N Motor Driver**: Facilitates motor control for direction and speed.  
- **DC Motors (2 units)**: Drive the car’s wheels.  
- **Battery Pack**: Power source for motors and Arduino.  
- **Chassis**: Base structure to hold all components.  
- **Connecting Wires**: Facilitate electrical connections between components.

## Experimental Procedure  

### 1. Component Connections  
- Connect the IR sensors to the Arduino digital pins (e.g., pins 2 and 3).  
- Wire the L298N motor driver to the Arduino:  
  - IN1 and IN2 → Digital pins 4 and 5 (left motor).  
  - IN3 and IN4 → Digital pins 6 and 7 (right motor).  
  - ENA and ENB → PWM pins 9 and 10 (speed control).  
- Attach the DC motors to the motor driver (OUT1, OUT2, OUT3, OUT4).  
- Connect the battery pack to power the motors and the Arduino.  

### 2. Upload Code to Arduino  
- Open the Arduino IDE and write or paste the provided code.  
- Upload the code to the Arduino board.  
- Monitor sensor readings via the Serial Monitor for debugging.

### 3. Testing and Calibration  
- Place the car on a flat surface with a defined line (e.g., black tape on a light background).  
- Adjust the sensor height and alignment as needed for accurate line detection.  
- Use PWM values in the Arduino code to fine-tune motor speeds.

### 4. Final Testing  
- Run the car along the track and ensure it consistently follows the line.  
- Identify and resolve issues with line detection or navigation.

```cpp
int leftSensor = 2;      
int rightSensor = 3;     
int motorA1 = 4;         
int motorA2 = 5;         
int motorB1 = 6;         
int motorB2 = 7;         
int enableA = 9;     
int enableB = 10;  

void setup() { 
    pinMode(leftSensor, INPUT); 
    pinMode(rightSensor, INPUT); 
    pinMode(motorA1, OUTPUT); 
    pinMode(motorA2, OUTPUT); 
    pinMode(motorB1, OUTPUT); 
    pinMode(motorB2, OUTPUT); 
    pinMode(enableA, OUTPUT); 
    pinMode(enableB, OUTPUT); 
    analogWrite(enableA, 200); 
    analogWrite(enableB, 200); 
    Serial.begin(9600); 
} 

void loop() { 
    int leftState = digitalRead(leftSensor); 
    int rightState = digitalRead(rightSensor); 

    if (leftState == LOW && rightState == LOW) { 
        digitalWrite(motorA1, HIGH);  
        digitalWrite(motorA2, LOW); 
        digitalWrite(motorB1, HIGH);  
        digitalWrite(motorB2, LOW); 
    } else if (leftState == LOW && rightState == HIGH) { 
        digitalWrite(motorA1, LOW);   
        digitalWrite(motorA2, LOW); 
        digitalWrite(motorB1, HIGH);  
        digitalWrite(motorB2, LOW); 
    } else if (leftState == HIGH && rightState == LOW) { 
        digitalWrite(motorA1, HIGH);  
        digitalWrite(motorA2, LOW); 
        digitalWrite(motorB1, LOW);   
        digitalWrite(motorB2, LOW); 
    } else { 
        digitalWrite(motorA1, LOW); 
        digitalWrite(motorA2, LOW); 
        digitalWrite(motorB1, LOW); 
        digitalWrite(motorB2, LOW); 
        delay(100); 
    } 
}
